    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe that is a staple breakfast option in many households. But don't you dare confine this cullinary masterpiece
        to only a morning meal, as it is so much more.
    </p>
    <p>That's enough talking, let's get <strong>BUSY!</strong></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Cup of all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 Cup milk</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 ripe bananas, mashed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking and salt in a bowl. Mix the egg, milk, vegetable oil and mashed bananas
            together in a second bowl
        </li>
        <li>Stir the flour mixture into the banana mixture( it will be slightly lumpy, but don't worry)</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using
        approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Cook until pancakes are golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
