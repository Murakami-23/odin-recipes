# Odin-recipes

Building a very basic recipe website.
It will link to recipes on found on other websites, from my understanding.

Skills required to build this website is:
*Git and Github(knowing how to set up a repository and moving it to my local machine)
*Basic HTML(Literally just implementing the bare basics of HTMl to build a website)

-Just finished building the website. Was super. I enjoyed the that I had to build it from scratch.
-My understanding of how git and github work is more clear.
-Everything I've learned so far about HTML seem to be sticking
